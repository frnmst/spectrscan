## Help

```
Usage: spectrscan [OPTIONS] OUTFILE
An unintrusive frontend of scanimage which acts as a
paper to pdf converter suitable for texts.

If the ouput file exists then the new scanned documents will be added
as the tail of the existing one.

The default system scanner is used.

Options:
    -h, --help                  print this help
    -m, --mode                  scan in Color, Lineart, Gray or whatever
                                supported method
        --list-modes            list all possible scan modes
    -o, --odd-even              preserve the order in double sided paper:
                                scan a batch of papers one side, then the other
    -r, --resolution            page resolution in DPI
        --list-resolutions      list all possible resolutions
    -s, --source                scan from the ADF, Flatbed or whatever
                                supported method
        --list-sources          list all possible sources

Default options: spectrscan --mode=Lineart --resolution=600 --source=ADF

## Relevant features

- Parallel immage processing (based on the number of processor cores)
  cuts the time by a factor of `#cores` after page scanning has taken place.
  This is very effective for a large number of pages.

- Odd-even page numbers scanning.

- Basic unpaper and ImageMagick post-processing.

## Dependencies and explanations

- [GNU Bash](http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/bash.html)
  - Scipting language interpreter

- [GNU Core Utilities](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/)
  - Basic software like `ls`, `cat`, etc...

- [Gawk](http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/)
  - Filter some output from miscellaneous commands

- [SANE](http://www.sane-project.org/)
  - Scanner software

- [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/)
  - PNM to PDF converter and image processing tool

- [unpaper](https://github.com/Flameeyes/unpaper)
  - Remove issues with scanned images (paper margins, etc...)

- [PDFtk](https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit/) 
  - Assemble the PDF documents into a single file
  - [Debian version](https://libreplanet.org/wiki/List_of_software_that_does_not_respect_the_Free_System_Distribution_Guidelines#pdftk)
    which is fully free
  - This "binary" [AUR version](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pdftk-bin/) is based on the Debian version

- [GNU Parallel](http://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/)
  - Execute image post processing jobs in parallel

- [Netpbm](http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/)
  - Fix the newly scanned immages by truncating the unnecessary parts. This 
    is mostly useful when scanning from the ADF
  - In my case I have an HP Officejet 2620 connected via USB to a server as a 
    network printer/scanner. Scanning using the "Flatbed" option poses no 
    problems, while using the "ADF", the image is somehow corrupted
    and it contains a black box adjacent to the scanned document.
    If I try to post process the image with unpaper and/or ImageMagick
    serveral errors are reported. The only solution I found was to use
    `pamfix -truncate`. I still haven't determined the cause of this problem
  - A "libre" version of the package is available in Parabola GNU/Linux-libre,
    described like this:

    > A toolkit for manipulation of graphic images, without nonfree parts and
    > patent issues 


## Coming soon

- Options to add
  - Compression
  - Number of pages to scan
  - Basic image enhancer options (to pass to ImageMagick)
  - Better options to pass to unpaper
  - OCR (training (GOCR)? + text file outputs)
- Better parallel processing
  - Watch inotifies for a new out*.pnm
    would be faster than post-processing in parallel
