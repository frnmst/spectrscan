## Help

```
Usage: spectrscan [OPTIONS] OUTFILE
An unintrusive frontend of scanimage which acts as a
paper to pdf converter suitable for texts.

If the ouput file exists then the new scanned documents will be added
as the tail of the existing one.

The default system scanner is used (so this must be already configured).

Options:
    -h, --help                  print this help
    -m, --mode                  scan in Color, Lineart, Gray or whatever
                                supported method
        --list-modes            list all possible scan modes
    -o, --odd-even              preserve the order in double sided paper:
                                scan a batch of papers one side, then the other
    -r, --resolution            page resolution in DPI
        --list-resolutions      list all possible resolutions
    -s, --source                scan from the ADF, Flatbed or whatever
                                supported method
        --list-sources          list all possible sources

Default: --mode=Lineart --resolution=600 --source=ADF

Dependencies: Sane, Imagemagick, Pdftk, GNU Parallel, GAWK.

## Relevant features

- Parallel immage processing (based on the number of processor cores)
  cuts the time by a factor of `#cores` after page scanning has taken place.
  This is very effective for a large number of pages.

- Odd-even page numbers scanning.

## Coming soon

- Options to add
  - Compression
  - Number of pages to scan
  - Basic image enhancer options (to pass to ImageMagick)
  - `unpaper`
  - OCR (training (GOCR)? + text file outputs)
- Better parallel processing
  - Watch inotifies for a new out*.pnm
    would be faster than post-processing in parallel
